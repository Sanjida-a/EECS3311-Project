Iteration 1 - Updated Plan

CHANGES IN PLAN
No changes to the previous plan for Iteration 1 as we were able to implement all of our detailed stories as planned in Iteration 0. The only difference is that since we weren’t expected to implement all aspects of the GUI in this iteration, we left addPatient's connection to the front-end for now since we need persistent data storage for this (and database is coming in next iteration).

BIG USER STORIES
Please see the Planning Document to see big user stories for iteration 2, as we intend on following that same plan.

MAIN DEVELOPMENT TASKS ASSIGNED IN ITERATION 1
-	GUI – displayLogin.java
o	Created a login interface and system so users can login to the pharmacy. This is connected to the logic class AuthenticateUser.java.
	AuthenticateUser.java checks to see if the login is valid
-	DisplayInitialScreen.java
o	Implemented so this screen shows once login is successful
o	Connects methods/operations implemented in other classes (as specified below) to the front end/GUI. Such as DisplayInitialScreen.java, which should be the screen shown after login is successful
-	MerchandiseDAO.java and UserDAO.java
o	Act like database stubs to hold some persistent data that we can get instances of.
-	Merchandise.java + Inventory.java Classes
o	Created classes and methods accordingly to create the medication inventory which contains important information about each medication.
o	Also added appropriate methods to allow adding new medication, removing medications, modifying existing quantities of medication, and displaying the inventory.
o	Also added a notifying mechanism which prompts when a medication’s quantity is lower than 3 after decreasing its quantity
-	User.java, Owner.java, Pharmacist.java, Patient.java
o	Created classes with special relationship with User.java
o	Added methods to allow each user to be able to complete specific tasks such as:
	Searching inventory for owner and pharmacist
	Adding patient to the system for pharmacist
