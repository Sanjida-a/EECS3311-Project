*Fixed Iteration2 Bug (which is also Issue #60, #69, #70 and partially #71)
*Fixed bug of allowing negative numbers as input for integer values (ex. quantity, price, health card number, phone number, date of birth) so that now it throws an exception.
*Fixed bug of healthcard number and phone number being integers and not being able to hold large enough values. Turned these to longs and fixed all associated methods/reading from database/reading from user from int to long.

*Fixed Issue #71
*Also modified owner/pharmacist credentials to be unique from patient. Changed owner/pharmacist login credentials to 4 digits long so that owner/pharmacist usernames are not 'taken'/'unavailable' to use for patient health card numbers. (Fixed a bug which prevented patient to have healthcard ID as 1111111111 since owner already took this username)
